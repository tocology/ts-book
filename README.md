# Typescript Book Repository

This project is for typescript understanding. So, there are some examples and guide lines.

Please give me feedback if you have any question or problem.

## Development

This project was generated by pre-defined scaffold.

However, if you just want to run and test codes, you don't need to follow **Yeoman Command**.

If you want futher information, please visit (Yeoman)[http://yeoman.io/]

### Yeoman Command

```console
> npm install -g yo
> npm install -g generator-gulp-sass-typescript
> yo gulp-sass-typescript
```

If you want light version only for typescript project,

```console
> npm install -g generator-typescript
> yo typescript

```

###  Build

```console
> npm install -g typescript@next bower tsd gulp browser-sync
> gulp install
```

### Workflow

1. **lint**: Lints JSON under ``./data``,  TypeScript under ``./source/ts/`` ``./test``and Sass under ``./source/scss/``.

        gulp lint

2. **build**: Compiles Sass and TypeScript files from ``./source`` to ``./temp``.

        gulp build

3. **bundle**: Bundle files from ``./temp`` to ``./dist`` powered by Browserify.

        gulp bundle

4. **test**: Run Mocha + Chai + Sinon unit test powered by Karma.

        gulp test

5. **serve**: Host app in static server and  refresh browser on changes powered by BrowserSync.

        gulp serve

The default task runs the **lint**, **build**, **bundle** and **test** tasks.

There are two additional tasks:

1. **install**: Re-installs ``bower_components``, ``node_modules`` and ``typings``.

        gulp install

2. **clean**: Deletes the ``./temp`` and ``./dist`` directories.

        gulp clean
